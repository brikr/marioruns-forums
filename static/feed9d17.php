Hi!<br />I just made a skin for NintendoSpy in the Hori controller format. <br />I took a photo of my own controller and coded the buttons on it and it turned out quite good and since I have not seen anyone have a Hori skin I thought I could share it if anybody wanted to use it.<br /><br />Preview:<br /><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/2i6fofp.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I don't require any credit or anything like that. I just want to share what I had :)<br />Also if the color is wrong from what you have it's quite easy to just photoshop it to whatever color you want exept transparent. I could do it for you if I find the time :)<br /><br />Here's the skin files: <a href="http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=09793652173400921118" class="postlink">http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=09793652173400921118</a><br /><br />First time on forum so be nice!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1605">STAMSITE</a> — 07 Sep 2015, 13:23 — Replies 1 — Views 132</p><hr />

I'm new to this so I'm wondering, why do we start the timer on reset? Also, do you guys press reset and start the timer, or hold it and let go? (while simultaneously starting the timer)<br /><br />PS: Practicing  <img src="http://marioruns.com/forum/images/smilies/BobOmb.png" alt="BobOmb" title="BobOmb" /> clips, super fun to pull off ^_^<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1604">SpatialParanoia</a> — 29 Aug 2015, 01:30 — Replies 1 — Views 118</p><hr />

Hi.<br /><br />I've been watching since January of this year and in July I started learning the game on emulator. I've only done 16 star so far but I am learning 70 as I write this and I plan to do 120 as my main category. <br /><br />I will be getting a Nintendo 64 in September and from that point onwards I will be taking the game pretty seriously as I try to get good. Until then I will stream quite a lot of my action as I learn the game and do runs and things like that. <br /><br />I don't know if you can post your links here but here is my Twitch <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.twitch.tv/soaringwombat" target="_blank">http://www.twitch.tv/soaringwombat</a><!-- m --> and YouTube as well <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SoaringWombat/" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/user/SoaringWombat/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1598">SoaringWombat</a> — 06 Aug 2015, 19:34 — Replies 0 — Views 116</p><hr />

Been playing M64 since I was 4-5ish, I've beat it 70 stars a couple of times over the years (never got all 120, I'm lazy XD) I really enjoy the game and hope to start running it soon. Got inspired to get into this (and speed running) after watching some streams and SGDQ 2015. Hope to get to know you guys better ^_^<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1604">SpatialParanoia</a> — 03 Aug 2015, 01:47 — Replies 2 — Views 120</p><hr />

So I recently got everything up and running with a wii and a capture card, but noticed that the quality was weird. Sometimes it was fine and sometimes it was not and I noticed that the quality actually change when im moving between loading zones. See video.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVzKfuHXzt4" target="_blank" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVzKfuHXzt4</a><br /><br />Im using homebrew channel on a white pal wii and installed sm64 with a wad file. It works perfect on the tv but not on the captured image. The capture card is an Elgato HD60. I've played around with the settings but without success. <br /><br />It woks if I emulate it with wii64 but that brings other problems.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1601">Axxtro</a> — 26 Jul 2015, 20:28 — Replies 1 — Views 122</p><hr />

Hi guys<br /><br />I've been watching Mario runs for a long time so I know that the game lags like hell in areas and there are camera strats to reduce the lag, but I've been surprised by how much I'm seeing now that I'm actually using an N64 myself. I don't know whether the amount I'm seeing is normal and maybe I just suck at reducing it, or if maybe there's something wrong with the console itself. Has someone documented the areas in the game known for lag spikes? Would be nice to make sure I'm not getting too much (think I might be paranoid cause the console was super cheap).<br /><br />Also I just ordered a gameshark 3.0 before I realised that there were subversions 3.2 and 3.3 etc. Is a 3.0 suitable for Mario codes?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />Not seeing anywhere near as much lag anymore. I moved my n64 from the floor thinking it may have been ventilation (I didn't have anywhere to put it when I got it). The lag is significantly reduced. Hopefully this is because of the ventilation and not just because I haven't had the console turned on for long. Maybe I need to clean it out?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1599">allanry</a> — 12 Jul 2015, 18:01 — Replies 1 — Views 151</p><hr />

Hey guys, I don't know if anybody actually comes here anymore but I thought this would be the best place to try and understand all this stuff.<br /><br />So I started learning Mario about a week ago. I found out yesterday that I am running it on the PAL console/cartridge which is much much slower. I have a CRT which runs at 50Hz which works great with my current console/cartridge. <br /><br />My question is, will I be able to use an NTSC console (which I will be buying soon) with my CRT TV without losing frames or suffering from performance issues? <br /><br />This is so frustrating because I thought I was all set to go and the only things left to buy was a Hori/Gameshark and now it turns out the only useful thing I have is a couple of controllers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1598">SoaringWombat</a> — 09 Jul 2015, 13:54 — Replies 2 — Views 163</p><hr />

I mainly just like watching SM64 streams, but sometimes do my own runs. I have only run 16 so far, but some day when I'm bored, I might learn 70 star and maybe 120 star. I have the N64 version from when I was a kid, but I currently prefer to play on VC.<br /><br />My 16 star pb is 22:46, so if anyone is in that ball park and wants to race or anything, let me know.<br /><br />Also a question: How do I get my times verified for my profile if I don't stream or have video proof? Is that not possible?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1596">pavis11</a> — 05 Jun 2015, 00:42 — Replies 2 — Views 162</p><hr />
