If you have N64 now then get a GameShark (version 3.x) and then use that, no need to waste time playing emu or VC, wish I just bought an N64 straight away instead of spending 9 months on emu LOL<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=125">GothicLogic</a> — 01 Nov 2014, 23:03</p><hr />

Hi Mace, pleasure to meet you.<br />If you are new then emulator is really good for practice because you can utilize save states. If you swap over to N64, consider purchasing a Gameshark (version 2+); the level reset code is very helpful and that way you can practice while still experiencing the proper lag you will have in runs.<br />It's not really worth it to get a JP cart unless you think it's cool. The time it saves in the categories where it does save time is very minimal. Really it's just up to you (make sure to get some screws or another setup to swap the backs of the carts though, if you do).<br />Not sure how long you've been running but 1:10 is definitely a good start! I don't have time to watch your run now but my guess is that the best way you can improve right now is just doing runs and focusing on consistency / movement.<br />mini<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1515">minikori</a> — 01 Nov 2014, 21:57</p><hr />

Hey I'm mace but most of my social media is cbmason, I'm new to the whole speedrunning community and decided SM64 was the game I wanted to learn. <br />Found the tutorials and discussions here are great and had a few questions I wanted to ask myself :) <br />What do most people do their runs on and practice on? I've been running on Wii VC and practicing on emulator which I understand both are frowned upon. I have an N64 NA Cart I likely will transition to once I have shaved some more time, but just curious if its worth trying to get a japanese cart? <br /><br />I've been working on my 70 star PB currently at 1:10:43 (awful, I know!)  I'll link the video below and any criticism is welcome and encouraged! <br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8EuPyrS4nY" target="_blank" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8EuPyrS4nY</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1552">Mace</a> — 01 Nov 2014, 16:39</p><hr />
