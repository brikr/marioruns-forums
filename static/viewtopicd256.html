				<h3>Single Star Leaderboards</h3>

				<div class="content">I was thinking it would be cool if we could adapt the spreadsheet to the site:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnYW5iKbuHktdHc1TllQNFkyX2lTWVRQRFlFSDFaUnc#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc ... aUnc#gid=0</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It would make single star times a bit more competitive than they are on the spreadsheet, as it would be a lot easier to compare times. There's a few problems with doing it, though. The spreadsheet is great because we can just tell people not to add times that use strats they wouldn't use in an actual run. With a leaderboard format, we couldn't really do this, as it would be confusing to people to see a #1 time on a star that isn't WR. <br /><br />The much bigger problem, however, is how much work this would be. While the current drop down menu on the site is perfect for just a handful of categories, you obviously couldn't have a simple menu for 120 individual stars. So it would probably be a lot of work. Still, I think it'd be cool, as the spreadsheet is way too fucking crowded and retarded looking.<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/simChomp.png" alt="simChomp" title="simChomp" />  <img src="images/smilies/sausage.png" alt="Sausage" title="Sausage" /></div>

				<div class="content">Really cool idea. <br /><br />Here's something I quickly came up with anyway. I think the Single Star Leaderboards should have a dropdown like the one in the mockup below. The user can toggle between the stage and find the top 10 times of each level in that stage to keep things clean and competitive. As you said though it will take a while to get everything ironed out.<br /><br /><img src="https://i62.tinypic.com/ih8xtg.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="https://i60.tinypic.com/1z3c9e0.png" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Would 100c stars be separate from their other star they're usually paired with?<br /><br />And also the spreadsheet is supposed to be all RTA strats, but that wouldn't be a very good idea for leaderboards.</div>

				<div class="content">I think it would be fine Clysmic if it's under the General tab, rather than the Leaderboard tab. Maybe even hide it under the Guides tab (as that is what the spreedsheet's initial purpose was).</div>

If you're referring to the way the leaderboards are designed (3 columns and star names instead of Agent, Secret Agent, etc.), I think it'd look confusing as hell, as SM64 stages have more than 3 stars.</div>
